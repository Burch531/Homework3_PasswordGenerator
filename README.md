# Homework3_PasswordGenerator

The password genarator will create a password between 8 and 128 characters that will contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters.  The password will not accept a length smaller than 8 or larger than 128 and if anything outside of 8 and 128 is entered the program will stop.
